00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,050
(Video Min-tae) Half of them are already

179
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,510
dead on the floor, so we can't just stop here!

180
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,470
(Video Beauty) Yeah!

181
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,722
Let us at least continue!

182
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,265
(Video Min-tae) Yeah,  
let us continue!

183
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,642
[People are noisy] (Administrator) It is unfortunate

184
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,478
for us as well to have to part with all of you like this.

185
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:55,191
But we will not completely close
the door of opportunity for you.

186
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,943
If many of you want the game to resume,

187
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,779
I will start the game again at any time.

188
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,241

It seems like you still don't fully understand the

seriousness of the current
situation. (Police Officer 1) Yes, sir.

306
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,655
So, you're saying
that 'strange people

307
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:39,827
gathered hundreds of unknown individuals in a

308
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,829

people were just shot dead, you know?

312
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,002
What was that game?

313
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,546
'Mugunghwa Flower Has Bloomed.'

00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,715

'<b>The Mugunghwa Flower Has Blossomed</b>'?

315
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,800
(Gihun) Yes, so you're saying

316
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,135
that the adults made them do that?

317
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,302
[Clapping the table] Ah
That's what I'm saying.

318
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,971
(Police Officer 1) So if they got
caught, they shot them dead with guns?

319
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,722
Ah, how many times do I have to say it?

320
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,723
(Police Officer 2) Sir,
so where is that place?

321
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,101
The place where those

322
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,770
people were killed, I was anesthetized

323
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,980
and taken away, so I
don’t know where it is.

324
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,481
Then what about the
people who ordered it?

325
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,441
They all wore masks
and disguises...

326
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,443
(Police Officer 2) Then how
did you get out of there, sir?

327
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,364
This was a vote among people playing the game
to see

328
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,324
.(Gi-hun) There were
more people wanting to leave…

329
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,450
.(Police Officer 2) So

330
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,744
the victims
said, ‘We want to leave’, and then

331
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,080

said, ‘Sure, go ahead’?

.(Gi-hun) Yes
[laughter of Police Officer 2]

333
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,960
Why did you initially go there?

334
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,338
Well,

335
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,757
they said if you play the game

336
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,801
they’d give you money…

337
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,886

341
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,475
So

342
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,896
‎(Officer 1) [Clapping hands] So, to summarize what you said,

343
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,816
Someone suddenly said that if you play a game, they'll give you hundreds of billions, so you followed them,

344
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,693
And then they made you play 'Mugunghwa Flower Has Bloomed',

345
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,612
And if you got caught, they would shoot you dead.

346
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,448
But you said you wanted to get out, so you managed to come out,

347
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,742
And you don't even know what those people's faces look like,

348
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,910
Or where that place even is.

349
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,036

354
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,463
Do you, by any chance, have a guardian?

355
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,798
(Police Officer 1) If you need help,

356
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,218
we can contact a medical institution for you.

357
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,887
[Slamming the table] I'm a resident of Ssangmun-dong who pays taxes here!

358
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,888
(Gi-hoon) How do you see people?

359
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,599
This is the business card they gave me,

360
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,893
so you can just call this number! Sir.

361

00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,422
(Woman 3) [In a sleepy voice] Hello?

367
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,632
[The confused groan of Officer 1]

368
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,718
(Officer 1) Ah, yes
Well, um, excuse me

369
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,638
from the morning Um,
may I ask you something?

370
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,973

Ah, yes, I'm sorry but um, is it

374
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,981
possible to play
some kind of game?

375
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,316
(Woman 3) A game?

376
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:17,859
Ah, yes, I do play games a bit.

377
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,404
Just tell me

378
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,614
whatever, and I will do my best...

379
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,573
(Woman 3) Excuse me

380
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,246
What kind of person are you
talking nonsense on the phone since the morning?

381
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,751
If you want to play games,
go to the PC room alone, you pervert!

382
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,132
[Sniffing]

383
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,761
(Gi-hun) I just pressed the wrong button!

384
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,762
Come on, don’t push, don’t push, let go of this

385
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,347
(Police Officer 2) Yes, sir, I’m sorry.
Please come back later!

386
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,099
Did you really call the right number?

387
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,350
Did you dial the wrong number?

388
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,893
Just wait a second

389
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,854
I’ll walk over and switch you over

390
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,565
The number you called last time
is still saved on my phone

391

[Automated voice] The number you are dialing
is not a valid number.

394
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,996

[Automated voice switches to English]

396
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,208
[Sigh]

397
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,837
(Jun-ho) What’s going on? Are you a drunk?

398
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,714
He’s just a crazy person

399
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,341
Today is just so chaotic
I’m going crazy, seriously.

400
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,926
(Police Officer 1) Get a grip
Are you going to keep coming here? Tsk

401
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,724
(Junho) I'm going in, take care

I'm here

(Gi-hun) Mom!

406
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,379
What's this?

[Dial tone]

408

[Automated voice] The power is turned off
Connecting to voicemail…

409

Oh?

410
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,514
[Automated voice is playing]
Ah, where did this old man go?

411
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,724
[Call disconnect tone]
Leaving the door wide open, jeez

412
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,359
[Sigh]

413
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,276
(Sang-woo) Gi-hun.

414
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,823
What are you doing here?

415
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,866
‎[Sangwoo's awkward groan]

416
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,453
‎[Sangwoo and Gi-hun's sigh]

417
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,836
‎(Gi-hun) Is it because of your debt?

418
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,465
‎Damn, hey

419
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,260
‎The pride of Sangmundong
‎The genius born and raised in Sangmundong

‎What does Jo Sang-woo have to worry about?

‎Go tell your mom everything
‎and start anew

423
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,771
‎Earn it back?

424

‎60 billion?

425
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,693
‎60 billion?

426
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,238
‎Oh, you said 6 billion?

427
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,074
‎There’s something those guys don't know.

428
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,411
No, you said you work at a securities company.

429
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,704
Did you invest in stocks?

430
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,789
The stocks aren't that big,

431
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,294
I traded futures.

432
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,253
Futures?

433
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,964
Are you spending that money on futures?

434
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,676
(Gi-hoon) Ah, whose futures
did you buy that are so expensive?

435
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,304
Did you get a girlfriend?

436
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,763
It's not that kind of futures,

437
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,183
[makes a smacking sound]

438
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,767
[sighs] There's something like that.

439
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,561
(Gi-hoon) Ha, really

440
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,775
Come on, can't I just apply for personal bankruptcy or something?

441
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,527
Isn't that okay?

442
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,238
It seems that if you do that
you don’t have to pay back the money

443
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,908
Everything has gone in, even my mother’s

444

Hello?

449
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,845
Yes, it’s me?

450
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,516
What?

451
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,518
[A siren is heard from a distance]

452
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,855
[Gi-hun's shocked breath]
.(Doctor) It’s diabetes

453
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,568
It has been neglected for a long time and complications have arisen
[Trembling breath]

454
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,696
It must have been quite painful.

455
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,031
Didn’t you know?

456
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,076
We just need to treat it, right?

457
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,869
In the worst case,

458
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,788
we might have to amputate the foot

459
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,706
.(Doctor) First, please get hospitalized

460
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,959
and let's observe the progress while treating it.

461
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,926
.(Gi-hoon) Mom!

462
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,765
Mom!

463
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,560
Ah, Mom, where are you going?

464
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,396
They said to get hospitalized!

465
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,480
.(Gi-hoon’s mom) Ah, I’m fine

466
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,732
.(Gi-hoon) What do you mean you’re fine!

467
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,985
Ah, you can’t even walk properly!

468
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,444
(Gi-hun's mom) Ayi,
Chiara, thank you.

469
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,239
You don't even come home, just

470
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,449
wandering around, and now you

471
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,326
show up acting like a good son?

472
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,287
(Gi-hun) Mom, why are you being so foolish?

473
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,455
They say if you don't get treatment, it's going

474
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,915
to be a big deal. (Gi-hun's mom) Is that so?

475
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,418
If I just lie here like this,

476
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,129
who's going to pay the rent?

477
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,339
And do you know how much

478
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,135
a day in the hospital

479
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,845
and the medication costs?

480
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,596
Ah, we have

481
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,681
insurance, right?

482
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,016
What do you mean?

483
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,393
Insurance?

484
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:48,148
Don't you remember? (Gi-hun's mom) That
was already canceled, it's all used up.

485
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,817
Please get a grip.

486
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,319
Oh my.

487
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,739
Gi-hun.

488
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,367
Oh, Mom is tired.

489
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,786
I’m struggling.

490
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,873
I want to be thankful now.

491
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,000
Thank you.

492
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,252
[Gi-hun's mother's sigh]

493
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,215
Damn it.

494
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,467
I’ll bring the money!

495
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,136
If I bring the money, that should be enough! Damn.

496
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,559
Yes, mother.

497
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,605
Ah, I’m on my way to the goshiwon.

498
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,068
Oh, nothing will happen.

499
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,112
Hyung sometimes does that.
He doesn’t respond to messages well.

500
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,619
Yes, I’ll call people around where my brother is.

501
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,163
Hmm, if I can’t reach him,

502
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,208
I’ll report him missing in person tomorrow.

503
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,213
Ah, I’m with the Korean police.

504
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,882
Hyung, I’ll find you.

505
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,510
(Jun-ho) Yes, mother.
Don’t worry too much.

506
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,471
[A dog barks in the distance]

507
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,306
(Jun-ho) How long has it been since my brother came in?

508
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,768
(Goshiwon owner) Well,
I don’t check every day,

509
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,771
but the date he paid for the goshiwon was
a week ago.

510
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,315
Since then, I've come every day.

511
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,902
They don't come in, and they don't answer the phone.

512
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,572
Excuse me, but

513
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,825
the room fee...

514
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,494
Otherwise

515
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,205
you need to take your things out now.

516
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,751
After I look,
the room fee will be paid separately.

517
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,087
[Laughter of the guesthouse owner]
[The lock clicks open]

518
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,339
(Guesthouse owner) Go ahead and take a good look, then.

519
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,681
[Switching sounds]

520
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,477
[Significant music]

521
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,551
(Jun-ho) Is that a drunk?

522
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,595
It's just a crazy guy.

523
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,263
(Officer 1) I'm so
overwhelmed today, damn it.

524
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,729
(Sister) Hey, kids, come have some ice cream

525
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,646
[Children's laughter]

526
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,482
(Kid) Wow, it looks delicious

527
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,817
[Sae-bok rustles the bag]

528
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,113
(Sae-bok) Why?

529
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,948
You said you wanted to eat ice cream

530
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,207
Why does your face look like that?

531
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,001
Did you fight with your friends?

532
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,632
If you keep saying that

533
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,425
I'm just going to leave

534
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,764
Me

535
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,849
I don't want to be here

536
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,686
Mom said she would come back soon

537
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,148
[sniffling] If I wait for a month and Mom comes

538
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,651
We'll all live together, she said.

539
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,405
Cheol-ah

540
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,368
- (Saebyeok) That is…
- (Cheol) The kids say it’s all a lie

541
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,620
I can’t leave from here

542
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,290
They say my sister abandoned me here

543
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,626
[Cheol sniffles]

544
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,546
I will go

545
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,132
Mom and Dad will definitely come

546
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,262
Sister will make sure of it

547
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,101
- (Saebyeok) Next year, we will all gather together

548
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,477
And we will live in the same house

549
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,188
[Cheol sniffles]

550
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,190
Sister, you know?

551
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,694
Sister always keeps her promises

552
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,456
Ah, that 'Mugunghwa has bloomed'?

553
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,127
But why does Detective Hwang
want the name of that crazy guy?

554
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,211
Ah, that…

555
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,671
I caught a glimpse of it

556
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,424
yesterday, and thinking about

557
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,341
it
it seems like someone I knew before, right?

558
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,093
Really?

559
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,305
Ugh, what was it? (Officer 1) It’s
that guy from Sangmun-dong, uh, uh…

560
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,306
(Officer 2) Seong Gi-hoon,

561
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,765
from

562
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,225
Sangmun-dong
(Officer 1)

563
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,685
Oh, right, Seong Gi-hoon
You know him, right?

564
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,187
Uh, yes, I think so Ah, could

565
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,691
you get me that person’s address?

566
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,573
(Man 3) Ali, it’s been a while?

567
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,122
[Game sounds are heard]

568
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,041
Uh, Ali

569
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,208
‎(Ali) Why aren't you answering the phone?

570
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,836
‎Oh, you called? I didn’t know.
‎[Mouse click sound]

571
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,713
‎(Boss) Why, why, what’s going on?

572
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,299
‎Boss, please give me my overdue salary.

573
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,552
‎(Boss) Oh, come on.

574
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,972
‎How many times do I have to tell you that?
‎I don’t have any money right now.
‎[Mouse click sound]

575
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,098
‎(Boss) As you know,
‎the company’s situation is tough, buddy.

576
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,808
‎That finger treatment wasn’t done properly.

577
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,852
‎(Ali) I didn’t get my hospital bill covered properly.

578
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,355
‎Ha, I’m going back to my hometown now.

579
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,023
‎Please, give me money.

580
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,108
‎(Boss) Hey, damn it,
‎ask the kids outside.

581
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,276
‎Did they get their salaries?

582
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,278
‎We can't give money until we collect, you punk!

583
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,698
‎Hey, I also have a few places that hurt.

584
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,576
‎But I can't go to the hospital because I don’t have money.

585
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,787
‎Boss, you said you would give me money!

586
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,704
‎[Mouse click sound]

587
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,666
‎Please, give me money.
‎It’s been over six months!

588
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,334
‎Ah, you really...

589
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,130
‎(Boss) Hey, let's talk later
‎I'm a bit busy

590
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,262
‎(Ali) Boss, give me money

591
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,640
‎Boss, please give me money

592
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,142
‎(Boss) Where are you touching?
‎You son of a bitch, damn it, tsk

593
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,811
‎(Ali) Don't cuss at me!

594
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,479
‎(Boss) What a fucking bastard

595
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,065
‎(Ali) There's money here!

596
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,733
‎- (Boss) You bastard
‎- (Ali) Give me my money

597
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,193
‎[Boss's strained groan]
‎(Ali) Here it is

598
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,403
‎(Boss) Aren't you letting go, you bastard?

599
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,196
‎[Ali's Straining Moan]
‎(Ali) Give me my money

600
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,533
‎[Boss's Shout]
‎[Machine Error Sound]

601
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,164
‎[Ali's Urgent Breathing]

602
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,457
‎(Man 3) Hey, you can't go!

603
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,375
‎Hey!

604
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,426
‎(Employee) I know your circumstances
‎very well, but

605
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,594
‎Kojou, the thing is

606
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,557
‎There's no way to find the brokers who ran away

607
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,934
‎[Pouring water] The person who got hurt
‎isn't just you

608
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,313
‎Some people went directly to Dandong
‎because they caught those guys.

609
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,274
Instead, I almost got caught by the public security.

610
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,235
I almost got dragged back to the North.

611
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,988
[The employee puts down the teapot]
Is there no other way?

612
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,784
Then we have to hire another broker.

613
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,787
But as you know,

614
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,707
we have to start all over again.

615
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,043
How much is it?

616
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,881
First, we need to reassess your parents' whereabouts.
Again.

617
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,843
(Employee) Yeah, these days,
the border security has become fierce.

618
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,512
[Pouring coffee slowly] The cost across the river has also gone up...

619
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,139
So how much is it?
[The employee places the courage down]

620
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,477
At least

621
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,147
it has to be over 4,000...

622
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,356
[The employee clinks the cup]

623
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,275
4,000?

624
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,986
That's just the cost to China

625
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,780
and from there to South Korea again...

626
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,739
[The employee's scream]

627
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,200
(Employee) Ah, it's hot, ah, it's hot!

628
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,786
[The employee's frightened moan]

629
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,663
(Dawn) Last time as well,
I sent the money just believing your words.

630
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,876
I risked my life to save that money

631
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,336
‎[Employee's trembling breath]

632
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,253
‎(Employee) Hey

633
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,631
‎I didn’t know either, okay?

634
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,760
‎I really didn’t know those bastards would take the money and leave me

635
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,553
‎I swear

636
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,889
‎[Employee's scared breath]

637
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:01,891
‎(Dawn) Money

638
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,393
‎I’ll get it

639
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,980
‎If you trick me one more time

640
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,275
‎next time, I will definitely take your neck first

641
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,778
‎Got it?

642
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,613
‎[Employee responds]

643
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,826
‎[Trembling breath]

644
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,830
‎[The door opens and closes with a clang]

645
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,456
‎Ah, it's hot…

646
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,887
(Sangwoo's mom) Are you eating well?

647
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,057
‎(Sangwoo) Yeah, I'm taking care of myself, so
‎don't worry.

648
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,727
‎(Sangwoo's mom) Oh, but you probably won't like
‎American food much.

649
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,104
‎What do you eat?

650
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,063
‎(Sangwoo) No, Mom.

651
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,315
‎There are a lot of Korean restaurants here.

652
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,608
‎Oh, really?

653
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,776
‎Ah, that's a relief.

654
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,944
‎[Laughter]

655
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,112
‎When are you coming back?

656
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,199
‎(Sangwoo) Hmm, my work is dragging on, so
‎I still don't know well.

657
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,951
‎I think it will take a while.

658
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,494
Oh, really

659
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,996
‎Our son must be having a hard time

660
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,914
‎[Sang-woo's mom sighs]
‎Mom

661
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,583
‎(Sang-woo's mom) Yeah, why?

662
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,880
‎(Customer) Ma'am

663
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,507
‎Please give me three boiled squid

664
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,134
‎Ah, yes, hold on a second

665
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,760
‎Sang-woo, there's a customer

666
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,722
‎(Sang-woo's mom) When you come back
‎don't bring anything, okay?

667
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,183
‎Mom doesn't need anything, got it?

668
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,601
‎Got it

669
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,936
‎(Sang-woo's mom) Yeah, don’t skip meals

670
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,730
‎Make sure to dress warmly

671
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,065
Our son, come in now, huh

672
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,525
I love you, son

673
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,985
[Sangwoo's mom smiles slightly]

674
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,403
Is it octopus?
[Call disconnect sound]

675
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,156
[Mobile phone operation sound]

676
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,422
(Sangwoo's mom) Oh my
This kid always says he’ll buy me something when he goes abroad

677
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,634
He keeps bringing things like this, tsk

678
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,511
It seems like your son is a devoted child

679
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,639
He graduated from Seoul National University

680
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,349
[Sangwoo's mom chops the squid]

681
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,475
(Sangwoo's mom) Business Administration

682
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,186
Oh my, Business Administration from Seoul National University?

683
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,523
‎(Customer) You have a good head on your shoulders and you look good too.

684
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,608
‎Are you married?

685
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,443
‎Not yet.

686
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,611
‎(Customer) How old are you this year?

687
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,154
‎Shall I set you up with someone?

688
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,115
‎Ah, but my son has high standards.

689
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,992
‎[Sangwoo's mom is skillfully preparing squid]

690
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,160
‎(Detective) Excuse me.

691
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,498
‎Are you by any chance the mother of Jo Sangwoo?

692
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,334
‎Yes, Jo Sangwoo is my son.

693
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,253
‎Where is Jo Sangwoo right now?

694
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,338
‎He went on a business trip to America.

695
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,673
‎What's going on?

696
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,132
Uh, this is the police.

697
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,510
(Detective) Uh, Mr. Jo Sang-woo

698
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,345
is wanted on charges of embezzlement and forgery of private documents

699
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,181
in violation of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes.

700
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,267
A warrant has been issued for his arrest.

701
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,768
Yes?

702
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,397
Who are you arresting?

703
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,401
Oh, detectives

704
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,987
It seems there’s some kind of mistake

705
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,490
My son
is not the kind of person who would do anything wrong.

706
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,034
If you get in touch with your son,

707
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,829
please let him know to voluntarily come to the police station.

708
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,290
(Detective) If he continues to evade...

709
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,375
Later, it will be disadvantageous in court.

710
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,255
‎[The detectives flutter their umbrellas]

711
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,757
‎[Dark music]

712
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,651
‎[Sigh]

713
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,127
‎[The doorbell rings]

714
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,672
‎[The doorbell keeps ringing]

715
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,466
‎[Sigh]

716
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,245
‎[Tense music]
Who is it?

717
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,004
‎[A swishing sound is heard]

718
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,826
‎[Thunder rumbles]

719
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,288
‎(Ali's voice) [Urdu] Where did this money come from?

720
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,500
‎Ali, where did you get this money?

721
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,584
‎[Ali slams the window shut]

722
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,254
(Ally) Listen to me
carefully from now on.

723
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,047
Take this
and buy the fastest plane ticket possible

724
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,757
You and the kid go back home first

725
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,925
What about you?

726
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,593
(Ali) You two go ahead first

727
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,513
I'll head over as soon as I finish work

728
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,683
(Ali's wife) Is something wrong with you?

729
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,934
Right?

730
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,394
(Ali) Don't ask me anything right now

731
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:42,398
[Ali's wife is choking up]
Pack your things and get out of here today

732
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,734
I hope you understand my situation

733
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,238
[Ali's wife is sobbing]
I love you, and you too, kid.

734
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,119
(Gi-hun's friend) [Korean] Where's the money? (Gi-hun)
Can you lend me 3 million? I'll pay you back within two months.

735
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,497
(Gi-hun's friend) Friends

736
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,166
shouldn't talk about money.

737
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,877
You know the situation for

738
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,920
both of us clearly.

739
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,256
(Gi-hun) Ah, I get it.

740
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,384
Ah, how desperate do you
have to be to say this, huh?

741
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,679
If I can't manage,
I'll do deliveries here.

742
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,931
(Gi-hun's friend) Come on.

743
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:16,849
What kind of deliveries?

744
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,642
Take a look inside. It’s hard
to even pay the rent here.

745
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,606
‎(Gi-hun) Ah, then
‎I'll just use it for a month and give it back, okay?

746
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,526
‎Ah, if I run deliveries as a part-timer
‎I can pay it back in a month

747
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,695
‎Hey

748
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,616
‎My mom needs immediate surgery at the hospital
‎You're really…
‎[The entrance door chimes]

749
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,533
‎(Friend of Gi-hun) Babe

750
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,827
‎Can you stop coming in now?

751
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,454
‎(Gi-hun's friend) I’m going in

752
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,206
‎(Friend of Gi-hun) Ah, get in right now!

753
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,540
‎Put out the cigarette!

754
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,584
‎[Gi-hun's friend shakes off the ash]

755
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:52,927
‎Hello

756
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,054
‎(Friend of Gi-hun) Gi-hun ssi

757
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:55,971
‎Yes?

758
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,099
‎You can't smoke in front of other people's store

759
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,520
‎Ah, yes

760
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,190
‎[The entrance door chimes]

761
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,947
‎[Thunder rumbles]

762
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,416
‎[Footsteps approaching]

763
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:32,800
‎(Il-nam) Huh?

764
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,594
‎You…

765
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,812
‎Oh, old man

766
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,730
‎That's right?

767
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,733
‎Number 456

768
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,776
‎Ah, yes

769
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,195
‎Yeah, that's right

770
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,615
‎(Il-nam) No, but
‎How did you end up here?

771
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,534
‎Ah, I live around this neighborhood

772
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,286
[Il-nam responds]

773
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,745
[Il-nam's laughter]

774
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,871
Um…

775
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,957
Do you live in this neighborhood, sir?

776
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,166
No.

777
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,379
I have someone I know around here.

778
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,672
[laughter]

779
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,175
Right now, I have nowhere to go,

780
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,470
so I’m borrowing your hospitality for a bit.

781
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,389
[Il-nam's laughter]

782
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,307
(Il-nam) Oh dear.

783
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,433
(Gi-hun) Ah…

784
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,642
Would you like to sit for a moment?

785
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,560
(Il-nam) Sure.

786
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,313
[They laugh together]

787
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,315
(Gi-hun) It’s nice to see you all here, sir.

788
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,358
(Il-nam) That’s true.

789
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,943
It seems we have a connection.

790
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,071
‎[Il-nam's laughter]

791
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,740
‎Oh my.

792
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,199
‎Ah, would you like a drink?

793
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,076
‎(Il-nam) Oh, sure.

794
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,244
‎(Gi-hoon) Ah.

795
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,622
‎Ah, is this a good place? Is it okay to drink here?

796
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,750
‎Oh, it's fine.

797
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,876
‎[Laughter]

798
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:49,918
‎[Gi-hoon puts the bottle down with a thud]

799
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,088
‎[Il-nam puts the glass down with a thud]

800
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,719
‎Ah, this.

801
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,180
‎What should we do? There’s no snacks.

802
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,807
‎(Il-nam) Wait a minute.

803
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,808
‎[Il-nam rustles]

804
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,268
‎[Clears throat]

805
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,691
‎[Laughter]

806
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,783
[Gi-hun's urgent moan]

807
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,160
(Gi-hun) Ah, are you okay, sir?

808
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,495
But isn't this
too much to eat?

809
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,704
(Il-nam) Oh, come on

810
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,164
[Il-nam's laughter]

811
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,376
[The sky rumbles]

812
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,421
I

813
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,676
decided to go back

814
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,552
Where to?

815
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,099
[Il-nam's cleared throat]

816
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,727
To there?

817
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,399
Anyway

818
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,402
I won't live long anyway

819
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,528
(Il-nam) Like this

820
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,032
I don't want to just wait for the day I die and then go

821
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,119
Do you know?

822
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,703
There?

823
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,790
I wonder if I'll be first.

824
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,252
That 'Mugunghwa flower' back then

825
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,964
came in before you did.

826
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,674
Ah, but still…

827
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,052
When I came out,

828
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,721
those people's words

829
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,558
were all true.

830
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,768
This place

831
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,354
is more of hell.

832
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,022
[Laughter]

833
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,444
[The sky rumbles]
.[Calm music]

834
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,117
[Bright music starts playing]

835
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,578
[Sounds of footsteps running]

836
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,495
(Organization member 1) Deoksoo hyung

837
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,331
(Deoksoo) Why are you so late?

838
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,208
(Organization member 1) Ah, I just came out.

839
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,919
There was a fight between drunk
customers at the establishment.

840
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,088
You know.

841
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,717
Kid, every time it's Friday night
those bastards just come popping out (Deoksu)

842
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,634
Where's the money?

843
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:03,969
(Member 1) Ah…

844
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,890
I'm in a hurry, so this
is all I could get for now.

845
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,142
I'll give you more after the

846
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,352
weekend, once
the bills are settled.

847
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,438
Ah, but right now the
chairman is looking for

848
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,065
you, and he said he sent those guys out in

849
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:17,983
Incheon and Ilsan.
[Deoksu's half-hearted laugh]

850
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,943
Where have you been hiding all this time?

851
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,945
(Deoksu) Well, that's not something to

852
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,280
discuss here. You brought the car, right?

853
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,532
(Member 1) Yes, over this way.

854
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,791
(This is the one that says 'The
Mugunghwa Flower has bloomed')

855
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,168
Is that an invitation?

856
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,419
Okay.

857
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,755
They sent that yesterday.

858
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,799
It looks like they
will start again soon.

859
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,134
So

860
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,888
Gather as many kids
as you can by Tuesday.

861
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,140
I have secured a few guns.

862
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,226
Is it a gun?

863
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,560
They have guns.

864
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,313
But one guy comes
out for the pickup.

865
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,566
(Deoksu) Catch that masked
bastard and beat him up.

866
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,527
These bastards are breaking
into the place where the safe is.

867
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,028
(Staff 1) Oh, that’s...

868
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,447
Even if what you
say is all true...

869
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,532
Son of a bitch.

870
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,034
(Deoksu) I'm not saying to treat
it as a fact, I'm saying it is a fact.

871
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:11,662
I'm sorry.

872
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,039
(Duksu) Ha, those bastards.

873
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,501
They are kids who stack
hundreds of billions in a piggy bank.

874
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,628
If you hit these bastards in
the back of the head properly,

875
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,546
[smirks]

876
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,049
Drunk guys at the bar Living by
just dealing with the nonsense.

877
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,175
