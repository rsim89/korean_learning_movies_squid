‎(VIP1) [English] 'Squid Game'

‎That's a fun name.

19
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,871
‎(Captain) A long time ago in Korea,

20
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,582
‎it was a game that children played a lot.

21

‎[VIP1 reacts]

22
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,628
‎(Manager) [Korean] Let me explain the
‎rules of Squid Game.

23
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,298
‎First, the attacker
‎enters the drawing of the squid

24
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,550
‎and must break through the defenders

25
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,262
‎and step on the head of the squid drawing
‎with their foot to win.

26
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,807
‎Second, the defender must...

27
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,893
If you push out of
the picture, you win.

28
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,272
Thirdly, either the
attacker or the defender

29
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,774
If the game cannot be continued

30
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,026
the other side wins

31
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,327
The state in which the game cannot be continued

32
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,539
What kind of state is it?

33
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,668
(Administrator) It refers to the state in which a participant
is deceased

34
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,173
Now we will start the game

35
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,092
[Heavy music]

36
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,181
(Captain) [English] Among the children's games

37
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,975
it was the most physical and violent game

38
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,810
(VIP2) In this game,
is any kind of violence allowed?

39
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,854
(Captain) Yes, there are no restrictions at all

40

‎[Taking Deep Breaths]

42
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,553
‎(VIP1) Why are you moving on one foot?

43
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,973
‎(Captain) The attacker has a handicap

44
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,937
‎so before crossing the waist of the drawing
‎you must move on one foot

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,980
‎(VIP2) Then the defender has to block that

46
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,232
‎(Captain) Yes

47
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,692

Because you're that kind of person.

72

388
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,150
How could you earn money so easily

389
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,362
that you do this kind of thing?

390

How much is real

396
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,631

‎Why did you come looking for me?

412
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,084
‎I heard that

413
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,171
‎you didn’t even touch the prize money

414
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,675
‎and just lived as is

415
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,348

That money is

420

(Gi-hoon) Why did you do that?

430

(Il-nam) You

431
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,780
are with someone who has no money at all.

432
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:47,121
Do you know what the common
trait of people with too much money is?

‎At some point, my clients

441
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,241

‎enjoyable in life

444
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,085
‎So

445
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,796
‎everyone gathered

446
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,383
‎and thought about it a bit

‎trust people?
