00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:25,962
(Man 1) Ah, yes.

533
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,506
Oh, then what about him?

534
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,894
If it's going to be teams of ten,

535
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,147
(Gihun) Are they going to make us do something like tag or
'Why did you come to my house'?

536
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,273
What, something like this?

537
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,607
[Thinking Moan]

538
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,359
If it's tag, you have to be quick

You just have to play rock-paper-scissors well

540

What will you do?

541
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,536
We already have an old man and a woman

542
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,330
The rest has to be chosen from the men

543
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:06,085
(Gi-hun) Then what if we make them play things like rubber band or game of air?

544
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,545
Women are better at those kinds of things

545
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,715
That might be true, but statistically
there are more games that favor men.

(Sang-woo) Right now
‎we're betting our lives

547

‎(Man 10) Hey, if you’re looking for a team

571

[Laughter from Group 1 members]

708
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,062
[Forklift warning sound]

709
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,796
[Elevator operating sound]

710
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,714
[Il-nam's cough]

711
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:04,052
(Il-nam) Don't be too demoralized

712
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:09,057
Tug of war isn’t just about strength.

713
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,684
‎(Man 10) If it's not by strength, what

714
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,436
‎Are you talking about tug-of-war?

715
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,522
‎Tug-of-war requires good strategy

716
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,232
‎And if we just come together well

717
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,152
‎Even if we're lacking in strength, we can win

718
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,112
‎(Man 12) The only one who can save us

719
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,156
‎Is the Lord alone

720
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,617
‎(Man 10) Hah, the old man
‎Looks like he doesn't even have the strength to stand, tsk, tsk

721
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,786
‎Stop saying useless things and conserve your strength!

722
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,706
‎[Il-nam's sigh]
‎(Gi-hun) Let's hear what you have to say.

723
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:40,589
When I was young, I used to participate in
tug-of-war quite a bit back in my hometown.

724
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,051
I had barely ever lost.

725
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,136
Even (Il-nam)

726
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,681
when there was a wrestler on the other side

727
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,434
and our side was at a significant disadvantage.
[The elevator rattles]

728
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,064
Listen carefully

729
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:01,860
From now on, I'll tell you how I won back then.
[Tense music]

730
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,529
I'll let you know that.

731
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,245
First of all, the person standing at the very front is important.

732
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:17,668
That person is the one who faces the opponent’s face
the closest.

733
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:22,923
The remaining team members are all
the ones looking at his back.

734
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:27,803
If that person looks weak
or seems discouraged,

735
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,722
then the competition is already over.

736
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,810
And at the very back,

737
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,898
someone sturdy needs to take charge,
like an anchor on a ship.

738
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:45,320
And it's important to place people well

739
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,531
by standing in a line.

740
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:52,202
One by one, divide them to the right and left
and line up.

741
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:58,125
Keep your feet straight in an "11" position.

742
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,795
Place the line between your armpits.

743
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,550
To receive power properly
[Group 4 members' tense breathing]

744
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:11,889
Finally, this is the most important thing,

745
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,809
the signal rings and for the first 10

746
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,477
seconds, [gunshot] [Group
4 members' straining groans]

747
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,104
You just have to
endure it. At this time, the

748
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,691
position is a lying
position. Push your lower

749
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,112
abdomen up towards
the sky and tilt your head

750
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:32,701
back enough to see the
groin of the person behind you.

751
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:37,456
Then you won’t
get pulled away as

752
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,084
long as you endure for 10 seconds, you'll

753
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:45,213
think, 'Huh, this is strange,
why am I not getting pulled over?'

754
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,966
The other side is going to be confused.

755
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,845
They must have believed that they were stronger.

756
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,640
If we hold on like this,

757
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:01,146
the moment their breathing breaks
will definitely come.

758
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,399
Pull!

759
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,735
[Group 4 members' straining groans]
[Rising music]

760
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,503
[Group 5 members' struggling groans]

761
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,715
(Male 13) Get a grip!

762
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,468
[Group 5 members' straining groans]

763
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,099
[People's straining groans]

764
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,817
[Group 4 members' struggling groans]

765
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,703
Hey, do something, you fucker!

766
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,956
[Group 4 members' straining groans]

767
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,293
(Sangwoo) Everyone, get a grip and listen to me!

768
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,797
When I give the signal,
just move three steps forward.

769
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,007
Move forward?

770
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,633
Are you crazy!

771
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,760
We need to knock them down!

772
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,303
Don't talk nonsense!

773
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,888
Let's do it!

774
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,640
(Beauty) No, I can't do it!

775
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,267
(Sangwoo) If you can't, you'll die!

776
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,184
We're going on three.

777
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,646
One, two, three!

778
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,647
[Group 4 members' straining groans]

779
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,945
[Heavy music]
