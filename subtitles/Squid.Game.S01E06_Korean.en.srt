This bastard will
ditch you in no time.

This bastard hid everything from you guys

199

just to save himself. I’m
right, you son of a bitch.

(Beauty) Huh, why is no one here?

209
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,428

(Il-nam) Back in the day, I...

235
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,510
I've lived in a neighborhood like this.

236
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,928
‎(Gi-hun) [smiling] Me too.

237
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,140
‎I lived in a similar alley when I was a child.

238
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,224
‎[Gi-hun's laughter]

239
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,815
‎[Voice guidance] Now please take one pocket each.

240

‎Each pocket contains ten marbles.

241
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,868
‎Please check the quantity.

242
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,791
‎Sir, it seems we're playing marbles this time.

243
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,502
‎You've played marbles before, right?

244
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,297
‎Oh, of course.

245
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,886
‎When I was a kid in the neighborhood,
‎ah, I played a lot of marbles.

248
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,225
I can do it a little too

249

‎[Il-nam responds]
Ah, that's a relief

250
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,520
I was worried about what would happen if you made me do something hard again

251
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,024
Then we

252
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,194
Have to become partners

253
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,570
Partners?

254
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,991
I mean, since you said you play with marbles
Do you not know about partners?

Ah, my buddy, ah, I
remember [Il-nam agrees]

259
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,253
There was a guy in my

260
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,713
neighborhood too
The one

261
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,423

264
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,347
(Il-nam) Is this how we make a bond?

[Laughs together]

266
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,183

‎Should we just sit here and
‎both die together?

‎die in my place?

Isn't it?

301
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,433
What game should we play?

Stop talking nonsense

307
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,739
Just tell me what game we're going to play

308
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,744
I don't really know either

309
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,665
(Ji-young) This is a game that the old-timers played when they were young

310
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,002
They said we can set the rules of the game however we want

311
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,755
I'll think about it

312
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,969
(Il-nam) Definitely

313
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,556
It should be around here, right?

‎(Gi-hun) Ah, Sir

321
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,996

‎Odd or even?

‎What's that?

326
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,426
‎Odd numbers are 1, 3, 5

‎Even numbers are 2, 4, 6

‎Do you understand?

(Man 6) Ah, damn

338
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,924
Should I have opened one more?

‎We have to do it too

358
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,846
‎No

359
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,850
‎What do you think I am, a kid?

360
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,478
‎[Il-nam's discontented groan]

361
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,521
‎Ah, old man

362
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,692
‎Let's

363
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,903
‎finish it with just one round

364
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,533
‎All in

365
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,159
‎Just one round

366
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,708
‎Do you want to spend the remaining time
‎with me like this?

367
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,254
‎[Man 1's exclamation]

368
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,547
‎- (Man 1) Awesome
‎- (Man 2) Damn

369
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,425
‎(Man 1) One, two, three, four

370
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,342
‎(Man 2) Come with me

371
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,260
‎I like it

372
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,095
‎What are you going to do?

373
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,930
‎Why are you in such a hurry?

374
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,599
‎Do you want to kill me like that?

375
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,102
‎[Sigh]

376
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,148
‎We're just going to play one round

377
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,984
‎There's still quite a bit of time left

378
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,862
‎Let's do it at the end

379
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,364
‎Then what will we do until then?

380
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,408
‎Talk

381
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,452
‎What kind of talk?

382
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,122
‎Talk we can't have with anyone else

383
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,336
‎One of us is going to die here anyway

384
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,131
‎Whatever we talk about

385
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,717
‎There won’t be an awkward situation when we see each other again

386

[Interesting music]

389
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,026

You fold

393
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,262
I don't want to play with that guy

394

‎(Ally) Teacher

395
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,558
I want to play with someone else

396
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,310
Don't say useless things and fold quickly

397
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,188
That old man has dementia

398
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,648
He's not in his right mind

399
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,609
If it goes on like this, that old man
‎is just forfeiting, isn't he?

400
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,152
We can't play the game, right?

401
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,988
‎(Gi-hun) Ah, damn it

00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,911
‎Just try it once, this really…

405
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,704
‎This is really fun

406
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,290
‎(Il-nam) I want to go home

407
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:43,547
‎My home is definitely in this alley

‎(Gi-hun) Oh, damn, seriously

409

‎Please, get a grip
‎[Il-nam's bewildered groan]

410
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,431
‎If we stay like this, we’re both going to die

411
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,891
‎You have a lump here

412
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,852
‎So you might not care since you're going to die anyway, but

413
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,271
I have to live and get out of here

414
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,648
I have to live and get out, Lee

415
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,899
[Il-nam's painful groan]

416
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,776
[Gi-hun's ragged breathing]
Don't scream

417
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,738
You just need to play with me

418
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,536

(Deok-su) Fuck, change the game

423
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,214
(Man 6) Why should I? It's going well.

424
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,885
(Duksu) So far,
I’ve been going along with what you wanted,

425
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,971
Now let’s do it my way,

426
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,891
I don’t want to?

427
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,559
[Laughter]

428
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,228
Fuck

429
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,274
(Duksu) Let me change the game
That’s the only way it’s fair,

430
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,068
You guys said this was an equal place, right?

431
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,946
(Byeongjeong) I admit it

432
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,206
What is it? What do you want to do?

433
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,417

You bastard, you

439
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,795
You’re using tricks, right?

440

Hyung

441
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,714
Why, why, why is this happening?

442
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,466
How can you keep winning?

443
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,177
The odds in this game are fifty-fifty, (Sang-woo) hey, you

444
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,264
bastard This doesn't make any sense, this situation right now!

445

No, I didn't do anything

[Ali's flustered moan]

447

You bastard, you pretended to know
nothing And fooled me, didn't you?

448
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,272
You said you’ve never
done this kind of thing before!

449
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,606
How did you trick me?

450
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,316
Tell me! Damn [The
gun clicks as it's loaded]

‎(Ji-young) Why did you
come down from the North?

453
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,245
I thought this place was better.

454
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,583
So

455
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,711
Is this place better?

456
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,135
What about the family?

457
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,553
Did they come down with you?

458
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,391
Just my younger sibling.

459
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,435
What about your parents?

460
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,152
My father crossed the river
and was shot, drifting away in the river.

461
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,069
My mother

462
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,533
was captured by the public security in China
and was dragged back to the north.

463
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,913
Where is your younger sibling?

464
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,252
In an orphanage.

[Il-nam’s laughter]

471
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,023

‎What if someone puts it in?

479
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,803
‎The person who put it in gets to take all the
‎marbles that have been thrown on the ground up until then

‎I can put them in the hole a bit too, huh?

[Man 6's laughter]

488
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,245
Are you going to earn money here and then leave

489
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,913
What will you do with it?

490
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,792
I need to find a house to live with my younger sibling

491
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,710
And I need to bring my mom from the North

492

Hey

494
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,674
With 40 billion won, you could do that and still have leftover

495
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,426
Is there nothing else?

496
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,636

Jeju Island?

499
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,770
(Dawn) I saw it on TV

500
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,815
It doesn't look like Korean land, it feels like a foreign country.

[Smirks]

502
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,650
Hey

503
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,944
What kind of scale is Jeju Island?

504
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,904
Well, it should at least be on the level of Hawaii, no

505
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,365
At least Maldives

506
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,867
(Jiyoung) Let's have a mojito

507
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,120
Mojito?

512
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,549
Oh, hey, you really won't make it

513
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,717
When you get out of here

514
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,970
You should learn from me how to spend money stylishly in South Korea

515
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:24,888
[Laughter]

516
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,186
Ah

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,163
I was wrong, Ali.

522
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,166
I misunderstood you.

523
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,127
(Sangwoo) But I can't die like this.

[Sniffling]

525
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,880
If I die here,

526
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,634
my whole family dies.

527
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,968
[Sangwoo sobs]
I'm sorry.

528

I also have family.

(Sangwoo) Hey, Ali, hey.

532
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,896
Hey, if you just help me

533
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,898
there's a way for both of us to survive

534
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,193
You came this far because of me, right?

535
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,279
I even gave you money for the bus

And the tug-of-war was thanks to my plan

We stood watch together all night

538
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,702
Until just a moment ago

539
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,704

didn't we?

‎that in the end, a few teams here

‎Why?

What were the rules of this game?

578
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,745
One person has to get all the other people's marbles in 30 minutes to pass.

579
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,789
(Sangwoo) But think about it.

580
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,833
There's no way for one side to definitely get all the marbles in 30 minutes.

581
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,877
As we go back and forth winning and losing,

582
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,838
there will definitely be a team that doesn't reach a decision in time.

583
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,216
So what will you do?
Will you eliminate all those people?

584
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,677
That doesn't make sense.
There hasn't been a decision, right?

585
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,804
Yeah

586
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,639
Then what about then?

587
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,058
We will have a team competition.

588
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,395
One team will combine their marbles,

589
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,480
and bet twenty against the other team

590
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,191
to win.

The first time I saw it

614
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,557
It was my mom.

615
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,935
When I came home from school,

616
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,898
my mom was lying on the floor, dead.

617
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,817
Next to her

618
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,696
was that man, my father,
holding a knife.

619
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,450
The next thing I saw

620
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,704
was the corpse of my father.

621
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,375
The one standing next to me with a knife

622
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,127
was me.

[Dark music]

624
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,590
That man was a pastor by occupation.

625
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,762
He would hit my mom

626
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,934
and after doing that to me,
always prayed

627
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,771
to forgive our sins.

628
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,233
But on the day mom was killed,
didn't you pray?

629
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,530

[The Elasticity of One Man]

901
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,583

With my wife and son

903
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,256
I lived in this house.

904

I, in the yard

905
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,138
There was also a small pond.

(Gi-hoon) There's one bead left.

908
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,642

When I get off work
and come home,

911
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,819
My son was having a
blast playing with his friends.

912
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,863
I didn't even know Dad was here.

913

Get a grip.

914
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,992
Pull yourself together and
listen to what I'm saying!

915
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,746
Then I will hide
behind that utility pole.

916
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:31,708
I secretly watched
my son playing.

917
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,252
‎[Sobbing] ‎(Il-nam) We were
having so much fun playing.

Ah, I'll ask you like this.

921
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,104
We all bet everything.

922
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,357
Shall we have a match?

923
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,611
Yes?

924
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,447
I'll stake everything I have.

925
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,700
Your thing is all in too.

926
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,871

I'm betting everything
I have on this.

929

That's fair, isn't it?

930
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,636
Are you saying to hang all
of this with that one bead?

931
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,473
Ah, where is such nonsense?

932
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,184
That's nonsensical!

933
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,104
Then

934
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,983
You deceived me.

935
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,444
You took my bead.

936
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,530

It's yours.

Don't you remember?

946
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,040
We made a pact by
linking our fingers.
