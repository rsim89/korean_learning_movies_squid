What do you want to talk about?

9
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,843

[Scoff]

11
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,596

Your heart has become very generous, huh?

13
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,812

[Gi-hun's incredulous breathing]
What would you have done then?

It was the last spot

16
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,610
That person was definitely trying to go

17
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,820
How can you be so sure?

18
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:35,905
That guy

The reason I'm still alive

25
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,502
Is not because of that bastard

26
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,379
The reason I am alive is

00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,799
I did everything I could to survive

28
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,676
No matter how many reasons you come up with

29
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,429

(Sangwoo) Your meddling is unnecessarily wide
but your head is fucking useless

41

00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,655
‎If you confess now,

135
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,740
‎you could receive leniency.

142
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,674
‎you must leave one in the chamber empty

143
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,176
‎and load one blank shell

144
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,387

If I was going to kill you, I would have done it already

183
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,543
‎[Trembling Breaths of Dawn]

184
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,757
‎I brought this because of that guy

185
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,510
‎For self-defense

186
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,914
‎You don't look too good

187
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,666
‎No

188
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,126
‎I'm fine

189
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,129
‎But why did you leave so much food?

190
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,133
‎It just didn't taste good

191
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,389
‎Don't lie

192
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,643
‎If you're sick

193
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,396
‎Will the uncle fix it for you?

194
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,107
‎[Trembling Breaths]

195
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,027
‎Don't worry about me

196
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,239
‎Just take care of yourself in front of the uncle

197
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,993
‎Hey, Kang Saebyeok

198
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,455
‎Let's do it together

199
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,749
‎Next game

200
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,960
(gi-hun) Whatever it is

201
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,088
We're helping each
other like a team.

202
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,513
Then we can beat that guy.

203
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,065
We're taking that money
out together, splitting it in half.

204
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,662
What are you going to do with that money, uncle?

205
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,415
First, I’ll pay off my debts

206
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,838
Then, I’ll get my mom a store at the market

207
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,429
Quitting street vending and running a store
is my mom's dream.

208
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,556
And

209
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,979
I want to take on the role of a dad

210
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,860
properly for once.

211
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,154
How old are you?

212
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,072
Ten.

213
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,160
You’re the same age as my little brother.

214
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,541
Where’s your little brother now?

215
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,418
At the orphanage.

216
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,258
I promised to go pick him up once I make some money.

217
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,304
I’ll bring my mom too.

218
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:30,270
If we just prepare one house for the three of us to live together,
we decided to do that.

219
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,150
Even if we split the money in half,
that would be enough and more.

220
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,906
Hey, mister.

221
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,579
Make me one promise.

222
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,045
What promise?

223
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,093
Either you or I,

224
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,555
if one of us survives and gets out of here,

225
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,309
let's make sure to take care of our remaining family.

226
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,190
Don’t say such things.

227
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,446
We can just leave him behind and you and I can go.

228
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,787
But still, promise me.

229
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,625
[The trembling breath of dawn]

230
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,754
I will definitely take care of my little brother.

231
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,508
‎(Gi-hun) Shh

232
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,649
‎[Tense music]

233
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,288
‎[Nervous breathing]

234
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,673
‎(Dawn) Don't do that

235
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,802
‎Mister

236
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,430
‎You're not that kind of person

237
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,475
‎[Calm music]

238
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,603
‎[Shaky breathing]

239
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,110
‎[Dawn's labored breathing]

240
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,779
‎[Gi-hun's sigh]
‎[Dawn collapses heavily]

241
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,909
‎[Gi-hun's urgent breathing]
‎[Dawn's labored breathing]

242
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,826
‎(Gi-hun) Hey

243
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,454
‎Hey, what's wrong with you, huh? Hey

244
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,455
‎[Gi-hun's surprised groan]

245
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,540
‎Ah, you…

246
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,542
When did this start?

247
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,586
When did you get hurt?

248
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,213
[Gi-hun's urgent groan]

249
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,549
(Dawn) Sir

250
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,467
(Gi-hun) Yes

251
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,929
[In a strained voice] I want to go home

252
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,889
[With trembling breaths]

253
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:11,932
Hey

254
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,850
Hey, Kang Saebyeok, pull yourself together

255
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,936
(Gi-hun) You can't lose consciousness

256
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,270
Just hang in there for a moment

257
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,022
I'll call a doctor

258
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,860
[Gi-hun's labored breathing]

259
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,490
(Gi-hun) Over here, please help
I've lost a lot of blood

260
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,659
Please help me! ‎[Gi-hun's
desperate breathing]

261
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,952
‎A person is dying!

262
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,162
‎There's no one there!

263
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,624
‎Hey, you bastards!

264
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,918
‎A person is dying!

265
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,588
‎We have to save a person ‎Whether
it's playing a game or whatever!

266
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,591
‎Please respond!

267
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,553
‎[Gi-hun's rough breathing]

268
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,388
‎[Gi-hun's shocked breathing]

269
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,515
‎[The buzzer goes off]

270
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,225
‎(Gi-hun) Ah, please

271
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,394
call a doctor over

272
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,728
there, I’ve lost a lot

273
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,063
of blood, ah, hurry, okay?

274
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,189
‎[Gi-hun's desperate breathing]

275
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,107
‎There…

276
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,066
‎[Gi-hoon's panicked breath]

277
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,988
‎[Heavy music]

278
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,824
‎[Trembling breath]

279

‎Dawn

280
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,185
‎[Trembling breath]

281
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,189
‎(Gi-hoon) Dawn, dawn

282
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:43,982
‎Dawn

283
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,692
‎[Gasping] Hey

284
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,153
‎No, ah, dawn

285
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,362
‎[Choking back tears]

286
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,823
‎No, dawn, ah…

287
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,867
