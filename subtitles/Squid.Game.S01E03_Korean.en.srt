How about we all come together like in the military?

88
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,857
That's right.

89
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,110
We never know what games we might play in the future,

90
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,530
so it would be advantageous to form a group to prepare for various scenarios.

91
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,575
Ah, let's do it together.

92
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,327

Did you see it?

94
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,040
This guy completely lifted me with one hand?

95
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,461

‎If it's okay,

105
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,895
‎can I join in a bit?

106
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,896
‎Oh, of course.

107

‎(Gi-hoon) Hey, this is

111
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,743

fits perfectly, doesn’t it?

[Gi-hun's laughter]

113
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,456
I’ll forget everything that happened
and take you in.

114
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,041
Come under me.

115
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,128
Originally, we were quite good as a team, right?

116
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,921
Are you still posturing?

117
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,634
The kids outside (at dawn) were all out looking for you,
spread out everywhere?

118
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,551
(Deok-soo) Don’t mess around.

119
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,679
No matter how tough you are,

120
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,432
acting all lone wolf here
won't give you any advantage.

121
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,768
Can’t you see this?

122
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,395
Those guys with masks

123
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,481
The beds of the dead have been completely taken away.

124
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,400
If you're not careful, your bed will be out soon too.

125

126
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,904

(In the early morning) Hey, guys.

130
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,243
Don't stick to this bastard.

131
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,915
This bastard is outside,
stealing from his little followers' pockets,

132
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,583
just fattening his own belly.

133
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,752
Eventually, he got so bold that

134
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,171
he even tried to dip into his own crew's pockets,

135
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,215
and got caught, ending up like this.

136
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,843
Do you know what we call these kinds of people in our hometown?

137
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,848
'Revolutionary son of a bitch'

Auntie, what are you good at?

152
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,002
I’m good at everything except for the things I can’t do.

‎You said you'd tell me in the morning?

376
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,798
‎If you were there for that long
‎you must have seen something

387
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,782
So they were just melting sugar like that?

I couldn't digest it

losing umbrellas.
