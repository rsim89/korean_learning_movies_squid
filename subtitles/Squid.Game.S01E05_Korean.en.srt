179
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,100
When the lights go out and a fight breaks out

180
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,061
I’d look for a chance to kill you first

181
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,316
Because you’re the strongest bastard

182
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,911
[The guys are joking]

183
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,373
[Awkward breath from Guy 5]

184
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,168
(Male 3) Hyung-nim

185
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,921
Where should we start today, huh?

186
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,297
(Deoksoo) Let's take it easy today

187
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,799
Why?

188
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,176
We need to keep the number down a bit for tonight...

189
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,594
(Deoksoo) I said let's just relax

190
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,681
(Male 3) Ah, okay

191
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:05,975
Hey

192
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,476
You guys too

193
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,687
Just put that down and take it easy

194
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,149
[Deoksoo's sigh]

195
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,111
Where did the doctor go?

196
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,529
(Male 5) Just a moment ago

197
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,532
I think I saw him go out saying he was going to the restroom?

198
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,577
[Meaningful music]

199
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,193
[Nervous breathing]

200
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,741
(Gi-hoon) The lights
will go out soon.

201
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,659
It won't be easy to attack.

202
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,788
Just in case, let's take turns as
the night watchman one by one.

203
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,955
Pair up into groups of two.

204
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,042
One person might fall asleep

205
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,337
and might betray us by siding with the other.

206
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,426
(Il-nam) I'll go first.

207
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,596
When you get old, you can't sleep.

208
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,514
Sir.

209
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,724
Ah, how can we stretch our legs and relax

210
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,684
if we trust an old man from the start?

211
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,356
I'll go first.

212
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,110
(Ali) I'll join you too.

213
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,279
I'm not sleepy right now.

214
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,032
Then I'll go next.

215
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,326
If I get tired, wake me up right away.

216
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,913
Then I will do it with you

217
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,332
If you're okay with it

218
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,501
Yes, let's do that

219
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,920
[Timer sound starts]

220
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,048
[Interesting music]

221
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,384
[Timer sound ends]

222
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,638
[Waves crashing]
[Seagull cries]

223
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,766
[Bell notification sound]

224
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,102
[Guidance voice] Today's duties are over

225
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,564
[Meaningful music]
Workers, please return to your accommodations

226
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,736
Workers, please return to your accommodations immediately

227
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,633
(Ali) Eat this.

228
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,304
I didn't eat during meal time earlier
and saved it

229
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,180
I was going to give it to the boss

230
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,391
Why aren't you eating this and giving it to me?

231
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,561
Thanks to the boss, I survived today

232
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,980
I wanted to say thank you

233
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,690
There's nothing to be thankful for

234
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,984
It's something I did to live

235
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,861
I also gave the boss transportation fare

236
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,237
[Sangwoo's sigh]

237
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,740
If you receive it, you have to give it back

238
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:16,832
Did you get it?

239
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,424
You said your name was Ali, right?

240
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,301
How old are you?

241
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,888
Ali is thirty-three years old.

242
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,891
Then just call me hyung.

243
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,685
Is that okay?

244
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:38,854
Hyung.

245
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,071
How did you get here?

246
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,949
I came to Korea to make money.

247
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,533
Hyung.

248
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,328
No, not Korea, here.

249
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,038
This game.

250
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,751
I came because I don't have money, hyung.

251
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,715
What about your family?

252
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,637
In Pakistan.

253
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,723
I have mom, dad, and siblings.

254
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,393
And in Korea,

255
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,645
I have a wife and a baby.

256
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,105
You have a kid?

257
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,149
How old are they?

258
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,901
I have a one-year-old son.

259
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,531
You must miss him.

260
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,950
[Sigh]

261
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,867
Yes.

262
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,416
Why did you come, hyung?

263
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,626
Here

264
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,424
I don't have money

265
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,634
I'm here to make money

266
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,970
[Meaningful music]

00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,805

[The door creaks open]

269
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,704
[The door creaks shut]

270
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,916
[The lock clicks open]

271
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:25,961
[Flashlight operation sound]

272
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,298
(Worker) Number 29

273
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,259
What happened yesterday? Why didn't you come?

274
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:34,845
(Junho) I'm sorry

275
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,014
(Worker) 'Sorry'?

276
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,352
The soldiers said they couldn't trust you and wanted to get rid of you
I stopped them

277
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,523
Last time you saved my life during the dive.

278
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,858
That's how I repaid you.

279
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,736
If you do this just one more time,

280
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,321
you're out.

281
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,041
[The door bangs loudly]

282
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,504
[The door opens with a click]

284

[Scanner operating sound]

285
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,937
(Soldier 2) Ha, number 29.

286
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,688
You've finally shown up, huh?

287
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,774
(Worker) I gave you a separate warning.

288
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,651
(Soldier 1) We couldn't even get the stuff delivered yesterday.

289
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,820
Is this something that can be resolved just by giving each other warnings?

290
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,905
(Worker) Then you guys should deliver it yourselves.

291
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,368
Do you think it's easy to find a diver like us in here?

292
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,121
(Soldier 1) Don't mess up the delivery today.

293
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,128
[The door closes with a click]

294
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:50,879
(Worker) What’s going on?

295
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,965
Haven't you finished a single one yet?

296
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,717
[Tense music]
(Soldier 2) Doctor, your hands are slower today than usual.

297
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,220
(Worker) Quack, hurry up.

298
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,306
If we miss the delivery time and the ship leaves, it's all in vain.

299
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,852
Every day, I can't even sleep properly
I can't even eat properly

300
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,689
While passing through the brink of death
Try doing this once

301
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,288
(Worker) So you don't die
They teach you the game

302
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,623
They even prepare food for you separately

303
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,460

(Sangwoo) Are you okay?

311
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,490
(Gi-hun) Huh?

312
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,202
(Sangwoo) It feels like you had a bad dream or something

313

‎(Gi-hun) No, no

314

‎[Deok-soo's sigh]

00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,590
‎(Deok-soo) Strangely, I can't sleep

319
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,927
‎(Man 6) I'm keeping watch well

320
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,054

‎(Man 6) Yes, it's strange?

00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,650
‎How long has it been since he went to the bathroom?

327
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,364
‎(Soldier) Catch it

328
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,037
‎(Soldier 2) It's urgent
‎Should I try what's left over there?

329
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:51,208
‎If you just tell me the tips
‎I think I could do it too?

330
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,627
‎Do you think it looks easy
‎because I'm just here doing this?

331
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,712
‎(Soldier 1) These days, when I watch the news

332
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,840
‎nurse aides and office managers
‎are even performing surgeries instead

‎[Soldier 1's laughter]

334
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,678
‎They say they're actually better than doctors?

335
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,805
‎If you're so confident, you should do it yourself

‎(Soldier 1) That quack who killed a person
‎due to a medical accident

337

Still, only pride remains.

338
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,439
You were doing so well,
did you ruin your eyesight last time?

339
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,775
You only got cursed out by the buyers.

340
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,945
Back then, you guys put a living human
on the operating table.

341
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,698
That (weapon) woke up,
and because it was thrashing around, everything turned into a mess!

342
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,658
(Worker) There's no time for this.

343

00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,112
‎[Awkward Moan]

357
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,656
‎It reminds me of the past

358
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,075
‎The past?

359
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,328
‎At the company I used to work for

360
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,205
‎we went on strike

361
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,250
‎We set up barricades like this

362
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,420
‎What kind of company did you work for?

363
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,172
‎It was an automobile company

364
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,799
‎(Il-nam) Hmm…

365
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,384
‎Yeah

366
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,135
Why the strike?

367
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,013
They say everyone should leave because the company is struggling.

368
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,309
[Il-nam responds]
It’s a company I've worked at for over 10 years.

369
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,106
(Il-nam) That must have been tough.

370
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,442
[Il-nam clicks his tongue]

371
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,986
[Gi-hoon's sigh]

372
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,446
(Gi-hoon) A baby is about to be born,

373
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,658
And expenses keep piling up,

374
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,746
But suddenly they tell us to leave with no plan,

375
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,626
The company messed things up,
And now they want us to take responsibility.

376
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,128
[sigh]

377
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,337
I’m angry,

378
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,133
And just like now back then.

379
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,469
We took turns keeping watch

380
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,013
I guarded the factory with my colleagues

381
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,849
[Il-nam responds]

382
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,768
I wonder when the police will come in

383
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,063
I’m trembling

384
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,983
(Il-nam) Right, about 10 years ago

385
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,946
There was a big strike at the car company

386
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,618
I think it made big news back then

387
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,998
Someone died there, I guess?

388
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,749
Hmm…

389
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,461
Oh dear

390
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,463
I'm sorry

391
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,423
I, this
‎[heavy music]

392
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,010
It's unnecessary talk, right?

393
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,344
[Il-nam’s awkward breath]

394
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,599
‎[Awkward Moan]

395
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,394
‎[Difficult Groan]
‎[Gi-hun's Sigh]

396
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,355
‎[Il-nam's Shaking Breaths]

397
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,065
‎(Gi-hun) Sir, ‎[Il-nam's

398
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,901
Difficult Groan]

399
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:46,818
‎Are you okay?

400
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,738
‎Huh?

401
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,199
‎Ah, you're burning

402
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,241
up. ‎[Il-nam agrees]

403
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,452
‎(Soldier 2) At that time, ‎I really
thought I was peeing my pants.

404
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,080
I thought it was a
corpse, ‎but suddenly it sat

405
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,625
up like a zombie, ‎with one eyeball
popping out, ‎and it glared at me.

406
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,878
Ha, that showed up in my
dream last night, you know?

407
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,213
‎(Soldier 1) The 'Mugunghwa Flower' game is

408
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,798
‎all about the guys who got shot with sniper rifles.

409
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,967
There wasn't much
to gain anyway.

410
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,180
That zombie looked somewhat fine on the surface.

411
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,475
I almost died delivering that.

412
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,311
I only have one kidney, so I couldn’t even get paid properly.

413
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,064
Is it my fault that that zombie only has one kidney?

414
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,067
Is this guy’s organs fine?
[Dark music]

415
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,987
Half of the people that come in here are either signing a body release or are terminal patients.

416
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,656
It’s really unsettling.

417
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,328
[Il-nam coughs]
Please lie down here.

418
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,496
[Strenuous Moan]

419
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,082
Ha, just wait a moment, yeah

420
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,793
I need to lower my pants, damn it

421
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,586
[Strained groan]

422
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,879
[Grabs the water bottle]
[Urgent breathing]

423
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,173
Damn it

424
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,550
(Dawn) Use this

425
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,762
[Urgent breathing]

426
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,269
(Junho) That zombie

427
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,230
What happened?

428
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,358
(Worker) What do you mean what happened?

429
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,237
I smashed it to death with that in a hurry

430
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,535
(Soldier 2) But why are you asking about that?

431
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,203
You saw it all too

432
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,162
(Soldier 1) What about you?

433
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,707
Don't you remember?

434
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,003
‎(Jun-ho) Ah, back then

435
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,047
‎I was so out of it

436
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,757
‎(Soldier 1) Out of it?

437
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,886
‎You cleaned up the corpses
‎with your own hands

438
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,973
‎Number 29

439
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,391
‎You…

440
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,102
‎(Soldier) This is my operating room!

441
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,228
‎[The soldier's trembling breath]

442
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,690
‎Please stop the nonsense and
‎focus on this properly!

443
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,233
‎[Angry breath]

444
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,193
‎Let's concentrate on the work!

445
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,489
‎Or else I'll just cut everything
‎including your liver and kidneys! Damn it!

446
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,953
‎[The rough breathing of the weapon]

447
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,290
‎[Rough breathing]

448
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,379
‎Thank you

449
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,089
‎[A sigh]

450
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,552
‎Take a rest

451
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,639
‎Gather your strength

452
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,600
‎You have to play together again tomorrow

453
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,186
‎[Gi-hun's sigh]

454
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,986
‎(Gi-hun) You should sleep more

455
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,572
‎I can do it alone

456
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,116
‎(Sae-byeok) But we’re a team of two?

457
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,911
‎Anyway, I'm already wide awake

458
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,041
‎Thank you

459
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,296
‎[Gi-hun's strained groan]

460
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,297
‎(Gi-hun) Water

461
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,509
‎(Sae-byeok) I didn't just give it to you

462
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,428
‎You owe me when you get water tomorrow

463
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,266
‎[A sigh]

464
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,647
‎[Gi-hun's hollow laugh]

465
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,737
‎[Jun-ho's strained breath]

466
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,280
‎(Soldier 2) Hurry up.

467
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,074
‎[Significant music]
‎(Soldier 1) This time, I'm in good condition.

468
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,951
‎Make sure to get the full price.

469
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,963
‎(Worker) Hurry, the boat has already arrived.

470
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,430
‎[The door shuts with a click]

471
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,064
‎(Weapon) Now tell me.

472
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,774
‎What's the next game?

473
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,109
‎(Soldier 1) We still don't know.

474
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,027
‎What do you mean?

475
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,237
‎[Tense music]

476
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,155
‎I don't know.

477
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,115
(Soldier 1) It hasn't been
delivered to us yet either.

478
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,867
‎(Soldier) Then ask your upper-ups.

479
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,703
‎There must be someone watching your backs.

480
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,580
‎(Soldier 2) If they knew, they would have already contacted us.

481
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,664
‎There must be some circumstances.

482
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,416
‎That's your situation,

483
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,586
‎you've done everything they've told you to.

484
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,921
‎(Soldier) Find out right now!

485
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,964
‎(Soldier 2) Go back and wait!

486
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,258
‎I'll let you know before the game,

487
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,011
‎(Soldier) Don't talk shit, damn it.

488
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,099
‎[The door slams shut]

489
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,406
‎(Worker) What are you doing?

490
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,033
Pull

491
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,178
[Significant sound effect]

492
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:28,952
(Soldier 1) Calm down

493
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,203
If you can't figure out the game

494
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,372
the ones inside
will kill me tonight

495
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,874
(Soldier 1) If you keep this up
you won't figure anything out

496
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,792
Give me some time

497
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,044
(Weapon) You think I'm going to believe the trash you guys say! Damn

498
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,462
(Soldier 1) So what do you want me to do?

499
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,089
You go out and find out

500
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,048
[Weapon's strained grunt]

501
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,591
(Weapon) And you

502
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,094
That guy is supposed to be with me here until he comes back.

503
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,388
(Soldier 1) If we keep doing this, it'll get even more dangerous.

504
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,431
We have to get back before morning roll call.

505
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,976
That's fucking up to you guys to figure out!

506
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,855
I absolutely won't go back to the barracks until I understand the game!

507
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,190
[Heavy breathing of the weapon]
(Soldier 2) Okay, got it, calm down.

508
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,402
Go up and find out about the game.

509
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,321
(Soldier 1) Got it.

510
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,907
[Tense music]

511
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,036
(Soldier 2) Wait!

512
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,913
You need to take the key

513
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,958
There's a key for upstairs in my right pocket

514
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,501
[The trembling breath of the weapon]

515
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,961
Don't mess around

516
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,296
(Soldier 2) It's true

517
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,715
You definitely need this to go to the control room

518
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,551
If you don't believe me, take it out and throw it yourself

519

‎[Fighting loudly]

527

‎(Worker) Don't touch it, it's a bomb

528

‎(Jun-ho) A bomb?

529
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,640
‎(Worker) This passage was created to evacuate
‎the VIPs in an emergency

530

‎Once everyone gets out

531
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,019
