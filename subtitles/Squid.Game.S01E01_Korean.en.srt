00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,886
[Interesting music]

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,898
(Gi-hun) In our neighborhood,
we called that game 'squid'.

4
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,195
It was named after a drawing that resembled a squid.

5
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,157
The rules are simple.

6
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,492
The children gather into groups,

7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,996
divided into attackers and defenders.

8
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,585
When the game starts,
the defender inside the line must move on both feet.

9
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,797
The attackers outside the line
must move like crabs.

10
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,593
Your mom

11
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,513
(Gi-hun) But if an attacker waits for the right moment

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,974
and crosses the waist of the squid,

13
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,145
they earn the right to move freely
on both feet.

14
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,194
Secret royal inspector

15
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,738
(Gi-hun) For reasons unknown,

16
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,449
we called that 'secret royal inspector'.

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,329
When they are ready for the final battle,

18
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,249
the attackers gather at the entrance of the squid drawing.

19
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,504
Go!

20
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,091
(Gi-hun) To win, the attacker must

21
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:35,804
step inside the small line above the squid's head
with their foot.

22
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,432
At that moment, pushed by the defender,

23
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,603
If you step on the line or go outside, you die.

24
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,607
Yeah, you die.

25
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,955
[Heavy sound effect]

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,415
[Children's cheers]

27
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,583
Hooray!

28
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,627
(Gi-hun) 'Hooray'

29
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,881
When you step on the finish line, you shout 'Hooray'.

30
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,925
In that moment, I

31
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,261
felt as if I owned the whole world

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,471
I was so happy.

33
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,872
[Gi-hun slurps the soup]
(Gi-hun's mom) Yeah.

35
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,043
What is this? Are you giving it to me?

36
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,046
(Gi-hun's mom) You, you today

37
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,424
You know it's
Ga-young's birthday, right?

38
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,385

‎What can you buy her with this?

43
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,607
‎Doesn't Ga-young like chicken?

44
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,276
‎(Gi-hun’s mom) You ‎Just

to feed her chicken?

46
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,572
‎It's her birthday, so you should at

money ‎(Gi-hun) Oh, why is there no money?

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,622
‎I gave you everything I
earned from my part-time job.

51
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,082
(Ai-gi, Gi-hun's mom) Oh my, that money

52
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,628
‎Hey, that's not even a month's interest on the loan

53
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,046
‎Oh my

54

Damn, fuck, you dumbass, I know!

86

‎It's just that the old
man changes it every

calendar, that's why it

[Scared breath]

227
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,048
It's because there are a lot of capillaries in the nose

[Urgent moan]

229
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,842

But I think tteokbokki is much tastier

310
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,118

[Awkward laughter]

322
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,273
The world you will live in from now on

323
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,901
is one where men and women
are equally treated.

324
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,194
Kayoung, you also
need to get a bit used to this.

if mom sees this,
dad is going to get scolded again.

333
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,049
Ah, is that so?

334
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,053
Hey, then I guess I'll have to keep this until you grow up

335
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,846
Just don't smoke with it

336

(Gi-hoon) Dad will definitely quit smoking

342
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,696
Next year on your birthday
I'll get you a really nice gift

343
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,865
I promise, Kayoung

344
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,201
Next year?

345
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,869

of relationship do you have?

720
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:09,292
Just looking at your face, you seem like a punk hiding

721
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
behind people like this, making a living off them. Did you send her?

722

(Younguk) How
can we believe that?

737
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,226
They suddenly anesthetized us, took our phones and wallets,

738
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,144
dragged us to a place we don’t even know, and suddenly they

739
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,481
show up and say if we play a few games, they’ll give us a large amount?

740
