‎(VIP1) [Sighing] No

‎(VIP2) The real competition starts now.

182

‎Big bets begin from here.

183
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,271
‎How long will it take?

184
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,775
‎(VIP1) Let's double it this time.

185
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,029
‎(VIP2) Is that okay?
‎I don't even know what game it is.

186
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,450
‎(VIP1) It doesn't matter what it is.
‎We're going for it with guts.

187
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,473
‎(VIP4) What's the next game?

188
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,309
‎Enough with the reveals now.

189
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,937
‎(VIP2) It seems like you're getting anxious because of number 69.

190
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,147
‎Shall we let you know now?

191
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,356
‎(Captain) Then.

192
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,692
Now I will reveal the next game.

193
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,411
‎[Meaningful sound
effect] ‎(VIP4) What is that?

194
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:21,123
(VIP1) What kind of bridge is that?

195
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,083
(VIP2) It looks fun.

196
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,086

[Sangwoo's sigh]

198
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,705
[Guidance voice] [Korean] Welcome to the fifth
game.

199
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,583
Before starting the game,

200
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,294
please select one number tag

201
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:12,174
from 1 to 16 hanging on the mannequin in front of you.

202
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,677
Once again, I will inform you

203
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,013
before starting the game,

207
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,275
(VIP1) It's interesting

208
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,946
Actually, the outcome of this game
will be decided here

209
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,616
(VIP2) There will be variables, but
the number is still the most important, right?

210
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,535
(VIP3) What number did you choose this time?

211
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,455
(VIP4) 96

212
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,998
(VIP3) Any reason for that?

213
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,876
(VIP4) If you flip 69

214
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,379
it becomes 96, doesn't it?

215
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,172
[Laughter from the VIPs]

216
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,925
(VIP1) I wish you good luck

217
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,218
(VIP2) Where did you meet someone like this?

218
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,220
‎(VIP1) I'm a stranger
‎I thought you brought me here

219
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,388
‎(VIP2) No way
‎[Laughter from VIPs]

220

‎God
‎created innocent and pure humans

00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,683
‎It's about going back to that day

‎Yeah

‎(VIP2) [English] Indeed
‎the middle numbers come out first

237
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,844
‎(VIP1) It's the nature of animals

238
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,724
‎When they feel fear
‎they want to hide among the groups

239
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,893
‎(Gihoon) [Korean] Ah, what should I do?

240
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,103
The middle part has completely fallen out.

[Elegant music is playing]

242
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,940
(VIP3) [English] Now the choice is left.

243
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,816
In front or behind.

[VIP2 clicks their tongue]

245
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,278
(VIP2) It would be hard for me to choose too.

246
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,822
(Captain) Then, may I help with your choice?

247
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,200
(VIP1) Yeah, give us a hint.

248
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,703
(VIP5) Have mercy on the desperate!

249
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,330
(VIP6) Hurry up.

[Button pressing sound]

251
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,460
[Guide voice] [Korean] I would like to inform you.

252
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,629
The number in front
of you right now is

253
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,590
The order of starting the next game is as follows

254
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,884
Please choose carefully

255
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
‎(Gi-hun) Order?

256
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,847
Order, you say?

[Significant music]

258
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,558
Yeah

259
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,479
If it's the order of playing the game
the earlier number has an advantage

260
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,816
There’s a high possibility that this game, like 'Mugunghwa's flower' or a lottery

261
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,776
will have a time limit

262
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,070
It’s better to start first

263
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,823
No

264
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,907
Wait a minute

00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,661
I don't even know what kind of game it is
It’s risky to go first

266

If it’s a later number like in tug-of-war

267
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,541
You can plan the operation by looking at the situation in front of you.

[Nervous breathing]

269
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,593
(Gi-hun) Number 16?

Number 16 can't be done.

Shall we start the game first?

276
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,073
Ah, then at the end?

277
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,035
Ah, that doesn't seem right either.

278
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,039
Ah, Seong Gi-hun!

279
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,626
‎(VIP1) [English] In the end, ‎the two numbers
at both ends are left. ‎[Elegant music plays]

280

‎(VIP2) Hmm, it's an

avoid both the

283

beginning and the end.

284
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,222
‎(VIP3) It must

00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,643
be quite frightening

to start the game

where your life is at stake
‎first, right?

288
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,319
‎(VIP1) But thinking about how most of the people who started last in the first game ‎died due to time
over, it must be terrifying to draw number 16. ‎(VIP3) You said you were with number 96, right? ‎[Responds]

289
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,988

I’ve spent my whole life hiding behind

I’ve never lived my life
as the main character, not even once.

Even when I tell myself
not to be that way, I always get scared.

Today, in the end, I just watched
others again

must determine which of the pair of glasses in front of them

is tempered glass

it’s a pass
